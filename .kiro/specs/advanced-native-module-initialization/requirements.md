# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Lynx autolink system only supports basic native module registration through simple class instantiation. However, many native modules require complex initialization patterns such as registering lifecycle callbacks, setting up global listeners, or performing application-level configuration. This feature will extend the autolink system to support advanced initialization patterns while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Glossary

- **Autolink System**: The gradle plugin and CLI tooling that automatically discovers and integrates Lynx native extensions
- **Native Module**: A Kotlin/Java class that provides native functionality to JavaScript code
- **Extension Registry**: Auto-generated code that registers all discovered native modules and components
- **Initialization Hook**: Custom code that runs during module registration to perform setup beyond basic instantiation
- **Application Context**: Android Application instance required for system-level operations
- **Activity Lifecycle Callbacks**: Android mechanism for monitoring activity state changes
- **tiger.config.json**: Configuration file that defines extension metadata and requirements

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a native module developer, I want to register ActivityLifecycleCallbacks during module initialization, so that my module can respond to application lifecycle events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a native module declares lifecycle callback requirements in tiger.config.json, THE Extension_Registry SHALL register the callbacks during setupGlobal execution
2. WHEN the Application context is available during setupGlobal, THE Extension_Registry SHALL pass the context to modules requiring lifecycle access
3. WHEN a module fails to register lifecycle callbacks, THE Extension_Registry SHALL log the error and continue with other modules
4. WHERE a module requires Application context, THE Extension_Registry SHALL validate context type before registration
5. WHILE registering lifecycle callbacks, THE Extension_Registry SHALL handle exceptions gracefully without breaking other module registrations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a native module developer, I want to define custom initialization logic in my module configuration, so that complex setup requirements are handled automatically by the autolink system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module defines initialization hooks in tiger.config.json, THE Extension_Registry SHALL execute the hooks during module registration
2. WHEN initialization hooks are present, THE Extension_Registry SHALL call the hooks before standard module registration
3. IF initialization hooks fail, THEN THE Extension_Registry SHALL log the failure and skip that module's registration
4. WHERE multiple initialization hooks are defined, THE Extension_Registry SHALL execute them in the specified order
5. WHILE executing initialization hooks, THE Extension_Registry SHALL provide access to the Application context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating native modules, I want the autolink system to automatically handle complex module dependencies and initialization order, so that I don't need to manually configure module setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules declare dependencies in tiger.config.json, THE Extension_Registry SHALL resolve and initialize modules in dependency order
2. WHEN circular dependencies are detected, THE Extension_Registry SHALL report the error and fail the build
3. WHILE resolving dependencies, THE Extension_Registry SHALL validate that all required modules are available
4. WHERE dependency resolution fails, THE Extension_Registry SHALL provide clear error messages indicating missing dependencies
5. WHEN all dependencies are satisfied, THE Extension_Registry SHALL initialize modules in topologically sorted order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a native module developer, I want to specify static initialization methods in my module class, so that the autolink system can call custom setup logic without requiring constructor modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module class defines a static initialize method, THE Extension_Registry SHALL call the method during registration
2. WHEN the initialize method requires Application context, THE Extension_Registry SHALL pass the context as a parameter
3. IF the static initialize method throws an exception, THEN THE Extension_Registry SHALL catch and log the error
4. WHERE no static initialize method exists, THE Extension_Registry SHALL fall back to standard constructor-based registration
5. WHILE calling static initialize methods, THE Extension_Registry SHALL ensure proper error isolation between modules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a build system maintainer, I want the gradle plugin to validate complex initialization requirements at build time, so that configuration errors are caught early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing tiger.config.json files, THE Config_Validator SHALL validate initialization hook syntax and requirements
2. WHEN modules declare Application context requirements, THE Config_Validator SHALL verify the module class supports the required initialization pattern
3. IF invalid initialization configuration is detected, THEN THE Config_Validator SHALL provide specific error messages with correction suggestions
4. WHERE dependency declarations are present, THE Config_Validator SHALL validate dependency names and versions
5. WHILE validating module configurations, THE Config_Validator SHALL check for common initialization anti-patterns and warn developers
